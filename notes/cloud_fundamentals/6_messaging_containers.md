# Introduction
Now that we know how to route users to our website and handle the incoming traffic, we will want the ability to notify or alert our users when certain events happen. 

As you add additional features to your travel blogging website like the ability to search or even the ability to make a hotel reservation, you might consider adopting a container technology like Docker to help you bundle your web application package that can easily move from environment to environment. 

In this section, we'll learn how to send notifications to our users using cloud services. We will also learn how two systems communicate using messaging. We'll then wrap up by learning about containers and why they are so useful for modern application development. 

# Why do we need messaging in the cloud?
There are often times that users of your applications need to be notified when certain events happen. For example, if a large withdrawal is made from your bank account, it would be nice to receive a text message. 

Notifications such as text messages or emails can be sent through services in the cloud. The use of the cloud offers benefits like lowered cost, increased storage, and flexibility. Through cloud services, you can send notifications and even track the life cycle of those notifications. 

**Messaging** is a form of notifications, but instead of human as the recipient of the message, an application is. Messaging typically occurs between internet-based applications and devices. One system can send a message to another system.

# Simple Notification Service (SNS)
Amazon **Simple Notification Services (SNS)** is AWS cloud service that allows you to send notification to the users of your applications. SNS allows you to de-couple the notification logic from being embedded in your applications, and allows notifications to be published to a large number of subscribers. 

SNS uses **publish/subscribe model**. This means that in order for your users to be notified, they have to sign up or subscribe first. Subscribers can be a person or another AWS service. Notifications can be sent to end-users using mobile push, text messages, and email.

Amazon Simple Notification Service (or SNS) is a cloud service that allows you to send notifications to the users of your applications. SNS allows you to decouple the notification logic from being embedded in your applications and allows notifications to be published to a large number of subscribers.

## Features

-   SNS uses a publish/subscribe model.
-   SNS can publish messages to Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP/S webhooks.

## Tips

-   SNS is found under the Application Integration section on the AWS Management Console.
-   SNS Topic names are limited to 256 characters.
-   A notification can contain only one message.

# Why do we need queuing technology?
A **queue** is a data structure that holds requests, sometimes called messages. A queue is similar in concept to waiting in line at a department store. People join the line and wait their turn ro checkout. Similarly, messages join a queue and wait their turn to be processed. Messages in a queue are commonly processed in order, **first-in first-out (FIFO)**. 

Let's say you have a money transfer app with millions of users sending funds back and forth. Instead of making user wait for confirmation while money is being transferred throug the platform, you let them know their request was submitted and allow them to go about their day. Behind the scenes, you place the money transfer request on a queue, and process those requests when system resources are available. Since the money transfer process along with doing security checks could take a while to process. 

The benefit of using a queue is that the user doesn't have to sit there waiting. The use of a messaging queue will help improving performance and scalability. The use of asynchronous processing where a user doesn't wait for a response, improves the overall user experience.

Messaging queues improve:

-   performance
-   scalability
-   user experience

# Simple Queue Service (SQS)
Amazon **Simple Queue Service** is a fully managed queuing service that allows you to integrate queuing functionality in your application. With SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between applications without losing messages. 

SQS offers two types of message queues: **Standard**, and **FIFO**. 

**Standard queues** offer _**Best-effort Ordering**_, while **SQS FIFO queues** are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once in the exact order they were added to the queue. 

Let's say you have created a course registration system, and to improve scalability, you send account creation and course registration messages to a queue. In order for a student to register for a course, their account must first be created then they can be registered. The ordering of these steps is very important. You do not want a student to attempt to register for a course before their account is created. Since ordering is important, a FIFO queue should be used in this case.

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that allows you to integrate queuing functionality in your application. SQS offers two types of message queues: standard and FIFO.

## Features

-   send messages
-   store messages
-   receive messages

## Tips

-   The Simple Queue Service (SQS) is found under the Application Integration on the AWS Management Console.
-   FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second.
-   FIFO queues guarantee the ordering of messages.
-   Standard queues offer best-effort ordering but no guarantees.
-   Standard queues deliver a message at least once, but occasionally more than one copy of a message is delivered.

# Why do we need containers?
Enterprises are adopting container technology at an explosive rate. **Docker** is the leading container technology. There are several container orchestration services that help you manage your Docker clusters. **Kubernetes** is a container orchetration system for Docker containers similar to **Docker Swarm**. 

## Why are containers so popular?
A container consists of everything an application needs to run. The application itself and its dependencies like libraries, utilities, configuration files, etc. all bundled into one package. 

Instead of having to rebuild your application and its environment from scratch as it moves from environment to environment, say from development to production, you can easily move the entire container from environment to envinronment with any issues. Each container is an independent component that can run on its own. 

Let's say you have a huge monolith application, that you're migrating to a microservices architecture. The **microservices architecture** decomposes large complex monoliths systems into discrete, individual stand-alone components that can communicate among themselves, working together, or with external systems. A Docker container works well with the microservices use case because each microservice is its own independent component with no interdependencies.
